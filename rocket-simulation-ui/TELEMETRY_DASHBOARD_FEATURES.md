# Real-Time Telemetry Dashboard - Implementation Complete

## ðŸš€ Feature Overview
The real-time telemetry dashboard has been successfully implemented on the Launch tab, providing comprehensive flight data visualization during rocket simulations.

## âœ… Implemented Features

### Primary Flight Metrics
- **ALTITUDE**: Real-time altitude display in meters
- **VELOCITY**: Current velocity in m/s with color-coded display
- **ACCELERATION**: Instantaneous acceleration in m/sÂ²
- **G-FORCE**: G-force calculation (acceleration / 9.81)

### Force Analysis
- **THRUST**: Current thrust from motor curve in Newtons
- **DRAG**: Calculated drag force based on rocket parameters
- **MASS**: Current rocket mass (accounting for fuel consumption)
- **MACH NUMBER**: Speed relative to speed of sound

### Flight Phase Tracking
- **FLIGHT PHASE**: Real-time phase identification:
  - STANDBY (pre-launch)
  - LIFTOFF (ignition)
  - POWERED ASCENT (motor burning)
  - COASTING (unpowered ascent)
  - DESCENT (falling)
  - CHUTE DESCENT (parachute deployed)
  - LANDED (on ground)

### Status Indicators
- **ENGINE**: Green when thrust > 10N, gray when off
- **CHUTE**: Green when parachute deployed, gray when stowed
- **STABLE**: Green when stability margin > 0.05m, gray when unstable

### Real-Time Updates
- **Update Rate**: 100ms refresh for smooth, real-time display
- **Time Display**: Mission elapsed time in seconds
- **Retro Styling**: Matches JARVIS theme with 8BitDo color scheme

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Use

1. **Navigate to Launch Tab**: Click on the rightmost "Launch Animation" tab
2. **Configure Rocket**: Set up your rocket parameters in the Simulation tab
3. **Start Launch**: Click the red "Launch!" button
4. **Watch Telemetry**: Monitor all flight parameters in real-time in the telemetry panel

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Design

### Color Coding
- **Green (#2E8B57)**: Altitude, stable conditions
- **Blue (#4169E1)**: Velocity
- **Red/Orange**: Acceleration, G-force, thrust
- **Purple (#9932CC)**: Mass
- **Pink (#FF1493)**: Mach number
- **Yellow (#FFD447)**: Flight phase
- **Status Lights**: Green = active/good, Gray = inactive/warning

### Layout
- **Left Side**: 3D trajectory visualization
- **Right Side**: Telemetry dashboard with:
  - 4x2 grid of primary metrics
  - Flight phase and time displays
  - Status indicator lights

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Data Integration
- Integrates with existing simulation engine
- Updates from launch animation state variables
- Calculates derived metrics (G-force, Mach, drag)
- Uses thrust curve data for accurate engine status

### Performance
- Efficient 10Hz update rate
- Minimal CPU overhead
- Smooth visual transitions
- Error-resistant design
